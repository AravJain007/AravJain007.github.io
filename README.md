# Web Portfolio

Welcome to my Web Portfolio repository! ðŸš€ This project is built upon the fantastic template provided by [codewithsadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio), with several customizations and enhancements to reflect my passion and expertise in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

## Features

- **Custom Icons and Images**: I have carefully curated and added meaningful icons and pictures that align with my interests and expertise in AI and ML.

- **Enhanced Template**: While the foundation is from codewithsadee's template, I've made various changes and improvements to tailor it to my personal style and professional focus.
